#I've made my own version of a Hangman Game in java at https://github.com/vitorbetmann/Hangman
#with more features (counts how many attempts were made, allows for multiple playtrhoughs,
#stores and displays a list of guesses letters, and warns the player if a guess,
#either right or wrong, has already been made)
