<hr />

<h3>The Lord of the Rings Return of the King</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie of all time since I was a kid.</p>

<h3>Parasite</h3>
<p>
  Close contender to my favourite movie of all time. <br />
  This was the movie that introduced me to Korean Cinema.
</p>

<h3>Get Out</h3>
<p>
  Even after having the ending spoiled to me, this movie still managed to reach
  my top 3. <br />
  This speakes volumes of how much I loved it.
